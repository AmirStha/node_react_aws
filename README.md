# React application with Express server

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The server can be proxied via the `proxy` key in `package.json`.

## Using this project

Clone the project, change into the directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/bottle-tech/iot/project-rt/project-rt-cloud.git
cd project-rt-cloud
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file for environment variables in your server.

Run the React application on its own with the command:

```bash
npm start
```

Build the application

```bash
npm run build
```

The React application will run on port 3001.
